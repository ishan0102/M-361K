# Real Analysis
This repo contains the source code for a textbook I worked on while taking Real Analysis (M 361K) at UT Austin. The `main` branch has a simple black and white version of the book while the `fancy-tex` branch has a much fancier version. 

The book is also available on my website here: https://www.ishanshah.me/static/pdf/real-analysis.pdf.
